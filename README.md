# TokenManagementSystemV0.3

This is an web application I made when I was at third semester. This application manages QUEUEs.

It has two side :

i) Customer side: Customers can take tokens for service. And wait in the Queue...

ii) Service Provider Side: Service Provider will login with their login credentials and can call customers and when a customer is done giving service. Then service provider can remove the token from connected mySql database and can bring next on top of list with a single click action button. 

Project Model: Model View Controller. I followed MVC fashion to design this application.

Used technologies : Java, Servelet, JSP, mySql, jdbc, html, css, javascript, tomcat server.
